# Consensus 2016 Hackathon

This post is intended to inform potential teammates of my background, ideas, and thoughts on potential toolsets for the Consensu 2016 Hackathon. The link to this post can be found on the 'participants' page of the [Devpost hackathon page](http://consensus2016-blockchain.devpost.com/participants), which I found rather painful to use, so here we are!

### Personal Summary

Hi there, my background is in infrastructure as code for various vertical including healthtech, fintech, IoT, and e-commerce. I've been working in NYC in small to medium startups for the past decade, and I'm currently doing technical strategy and incubation at a macro fund.

In addition to my day job, I'm the founder of the [Docker NYC Meetup](https://twitter.com/Jesse_White/) group that's grown to over 2500 members. I'm also an entrepreneur looking to explore and expand into my knowledge of the blockchain, ledger, and smart contracts.  I have some Python and scripting skills, plus the usual DevOps toolset that comes with a background in working with Cloud Servivce Providers (CSP). Feel free to [ping me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jesse_White/).

### Some Ideas

1. A voting app that could replace the electoral college and recreate the general election, utilizing Personally Identifying Information (PII) and Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) protocols via public domain records. Similar ideas [here](https://goo.gl/i4u2TI).


1. Smart contracts for contractors that execute payment upon the execution of agreed upon tests that satisfy acceptance criteria.

1. Use IPFS and Filecoin to create a distributed photo sharing application with Ethereum. The focus here would be on the tech, not the idea.

1. A Virtual Home Owners Association application that would allow for easier collaboration between neighbors for organizing purposes.

1 Use the various NYC Open Data tools in conjunction with the blockchain to identify trends in housing, traffic, crime, real estate, contracts and other occurences : https://data.cityofnewyork.us/data.

### Interesting Toolsets

There's a lot of great tools out there that we could take advantage of, including what's being judged.

1. Eris
1. Counterparty
1. Truffle
1. TestRPC
1. Docker
1. Kubernetes

If you've made it this far, awesome! I've gone ahead and created both a Github Organization called 'HackTheChain' and also a repository for potential code. I've found it much easier to walk into these sorts of events with some pre-gaming already done, so if youi'd like to join forces or just bounce ideas around, go ahead and join the org or post some issues. You can find the team and the repository here:
